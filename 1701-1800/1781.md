# 1781. Sum of Beauty of All Substrings
Difficulty medium

The beauty of a string is the difference in frequencies between the most frequent and least frequent characters.

For example, the beauty of "abaacc" is 3 - 1 = 2.
Given a string s, return the sum of beauty of all of its substrings.


## Example 1:
```
Input: s = "aabcb"
Output: 5
Explanation: The substrings with non-zero beauty are ["aab","aabc","aabcb","abcb","bcb"], each with beauty equal to 1.
```


## Example 2:
```
Input: s = "aabcbaa"
Output: 17
```


```
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 500
s consists of only lowercase English letters.
```

class Solution {
public:
    int beautySum(string s) {
        int n = s.length(), ans = 0;;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            vector<int> hash(26);
            int mx = INT_MIN;
            for (int j = i; j < n; ++j) {
                mx = max(mx, ++hash[s[j] - 'a']);
                int mn = INT_MAX;
                for (int v : hash) {
                    if (v > 0) mn = min(mn, v);
                }
                ans += (mx - mn);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
