# 1705. Maximum Number of Eaten Apples
Difficulty medium

There is a special kind of apple tree that grows apples every day for n days. On the ith day, the tree grows apples[i] apples that will rot after days[i] days, that is on day i + days[i] the apples will be rotten and cannot be eaten. On some days, the apple tree does not grow any apples, which are denoted by apples[i] == 0 and days[i] == 0.

You decided to eat at most one apple a day (to keep the doctors away). Note that you can keep eating after the first n days.

Given two integer arrays days and apples of length n, return the maximum number of apples you can eat.


## Example 1:
```
Input: apples = [1,2,3,5,2], days = [3,2,1,4,2]
Output: 7
Explanation: You can eat 7 apples:
- On the first day, you eat an apple that grew on the first day.
- On the second day, you eat an apple that grew on the second day.
- On the third day, you eat an apple that grew on the second day. After this day, the apples that grew on the third day rot.
- On the fourth to the seventh days, you eat apples that grew on the fourth day.
```


## Example 2:
```
Input: apples = [3,0,0,0,0,2], days = [3,0,0,0,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can eat 5 apples:
- On the first to the third day you eat apples that grew on the first day.
- Do nothing on the fouth and fifth days.
- On the sixth and seventh days you eat apples that grew on the sixth day.
```


```
Constraints:

n == apples.length == days.length
1 <= n <= 2 * 104
0 <= apples[i], days[i] <= 2 * 104
days[i] = 0 if and only if apples[i] = 0.
```

class Solution {
public:
    int eatenApples(vector<int>& apples, vector<int>& days) {
        auto cmp = [](auto& a, auto& b) {
            return a.first > b.first;
        };
        priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, decltype(cmp)> pq(cmp);

        int n = apples.size(), idx = 0, ans = 0;
        while (idx < n || !pq.empty()) {
            if (idx < n && apples[idx] > 0) pq.push({idx + days[idx] - 1, apples[idx]});
            while (!pq.empty() && pq.top().first < idx) pq.pop();
            if (!pq.empty()) {
                auto [t, c] = pq.top(); pq.pop();
                if (--c > 0 && t >= idx + 1) pq.push({t, c});
                ++ans;
            }
            ++idx;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
