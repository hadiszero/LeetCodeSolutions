# 2260. Minimum Consecutive Cards to Pick Up
Difficulty medium

You are given an integer array cards where cards[i] represents the value of the ith card. A pair of cards are matching if the cards have the same value.

Return the minimum number of consecutive cards you have to pick up to have a pair of matching cards among the picked cards. If it is impossible to have matching cards, return -1.


## Example 1:
```
Input: cards = [3,4,2,3,4,7]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can pick up the cards [3,4,2,3] which contain a matching pair of cards with value 3. Note that picking up the cards [4,2,3,4] is also optimal.
```


## Example 2:
```
Input: cards = [1,0,5,3]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no way to pick up a set of consecutive cards that contain a pair of matching cards.
```


```
Constraints:

1 <= cards.length <= 105
0 <= cards[i] <= 106
```

        for (int i = 0; i < cards.size(); ++i) {
            if (hash[cards[i]] != -1) ans = min(ans, i - hash[cards[i]] + 1);
            hash[cards[i]] = i;
        }
        return ans == INT_MAX ? -1 : ans;
    }
};
