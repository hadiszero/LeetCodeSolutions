# 1262. Greatest Sum Divisible by Three
Difficulty medium

Given an integer array nums, return the maximum possible sum of elements of the array such that it is divisible by three.


## Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [3,6,5,1,8]
Output: 18
Explanation: Pick numbers 3, 6, 1 and 8 their sum is 18 (maximum sum divisible by 3).
```


## Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [4]
Output: 0
Explanation: Since 4 is not divisible by 3, do not pick any number.
```


## Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4]
Output: 12
Explanation: Pick numbers 1, 3, 4 and 4 their sum is 12 (maximum sum divisible by 3).
```


```
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 4 * 104
1 <= nums[i] <= 104
```

class Solution {
public:
    int maxSumDivThree(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> f(3);
        for (int v : nums) {
            int a = f[0] + v, b = f[1] + v, c = f[2] + v;
            f[a % 3] = max(f[a % 3], a);
            f[b % 3] = max(f[b % 3], b);
            f[c % 3] = max(f[c % 3], c);
        }
        return f[0];
    }
};
