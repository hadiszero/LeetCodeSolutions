# 1222. Queens That Can Attack the King
Difficulty medium

On a 0-indexed 8 x 8 chessboard, there can be multiple black queens ad one white king.

You are given a 2D integer array queens where queens[i] = [xQueeni, yQueeni] represents the position of the ith black queen on the chessboard. You are also given an integer array king of length 2 where king = [xKing, yKing] represents the position of the white king.

Return the coordinates of the black queens that can directly attack the king. You may return the answer in any order.


## Example 1:
```
Input: queens = [[0,1],[1,0],[4,0],[0,4],[3,3],[2,4]], king = [0,0]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[3,3]]
Explanation: The diagram above shows the three queens that can directly attack the king and the three queens that cannot attack the king (i.e., marked with red dashes).
```


## Example 2:
```
Input: queens = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,2],[3,4],[3,5],[4,4],[4,5]], king = [3,3]
Output: [[2,2],[3,4],[4,4]]
Explanation: The diagram above shows the three queens that can directly attack the king and the three queens that cannot attack the king (i.e., marked with red dashes).
```


```
Constraints:

1 <= queens.length < 64
queens[i].length == king.length == 2
0 <= xQueeni, yQueeni, xKing, yKing < 8
All the given positions are unique.
```
