# 1228. Missing Number In Arithmetic Progression
Difficulty easy

In some array arr, the values were in arithmetic progression: the values arr[i + 1] - arr[i] are all equal for every 0 <= i < arr.length - 1.

A value from arr was removed that was not the first or last value in the array.

Given arr, return the removed value.


## Example 1:
```
Input: arr = [5,7,11,13]
Output: 9
Explanation: The previous array was [5,7,9,11,13].
```


## Example 2:
```
Input: arr = [15,13,12]
Output: 14
Explanation: The previous array was [15,14,13,12].
```


```
Constraints:

3 <= arr.length <= 1000
0 <= arr[i] <= 105
The given array is guaranteed to be a valid array.
```

        int sum = (arr[0] + arr[n - 1]) * (n + 1) / 2;
        int gap = (arr[n - 1] - arr[0]) / n;
        if (gap == 0) return arr[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            int diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1];
            if (diff != gap) return arr[i - 1] + gap;
        }
        return 0;
    }
};
