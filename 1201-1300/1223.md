# 1223. Dice Roll Simulation
Difficulty hard

A die simulator generates a random number from 1 to 6 for each roll. You introduced a constraint to the generator such that it cannot roll the number i more than rollMax[i] (1-indexed) consecutive times.

Given an array of integers rollMax and an integer n, return the number of distinct sequences that can be obtained with exact n rolls. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Two sequences are considered different if at least one element differs from each other.


## Example 1:
```
Input: n = 2, rollMax = [1,1,2,2,2,3]
Output: 34
Explanation: There will be 2 rolls of die, if there are no constraints on the die, there are 6 * 6 = 36 possible combinations. In this case, looking at rollMax array, the numbers 1 and 2 appear at most once consecutively, therefore sequences (1,1) and (2,2) cannot occur, so the final answer is 36-2 = 34.
```


## Example 2:
```
Input: n = 2, rollMax = [1,1,1,1,1,1]
Output: 30
```


## Example 3:
```
Input: n = 3, rollMax = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
Output: 181
```


```
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 5000
rollMax.length == 6
1 <= rollMax[i] <= 15
```

                        } else if (k + 1 <= rollMax[j]) {
                            f[i][p][k + 1] = (f[i][p][k + 1] + f[i - 1][j][k]) % MOD;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        int ans = 0;
