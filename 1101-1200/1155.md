# 1155. Number of Dice Rolls With Target Sum
Difficulty medium

You have n dice, and each die has k faces numbered from 1 to k.

Given three integers n, k, and target, return the number of possible ways (out of the kn total ways) to roll the dice, so the sum of the face-up numbers equals target. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.


## Example 1:
```
Input: n = 1, k = 6, target = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: You throw one die with 6 faces.
There is only one way to get a sum of 3.
```


## Example 2:
```
Input: n = 2, k = 6, target = 7
Output: 6
Explanation: You throw two dice, each with 6 faces.
There are 6 ways to get a sum of 7: 1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1.
```


## Example 3:
```
Input: n = 30, k = 30, target = 500
Output: 222616187
Explanation: The answer must be returned modulo 109 + 7.
```


```
Constraints:

1 <= n, k <= 30
1 <= target <= 1000
```

        f[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = target; j >= 0; --j) {
                f[j] = 0;
                for (int p = 1; p <= k; ++p) {
                    if (j >= p) f[j] += f[j - p];
                    if (f[j] >= MOD) f[j] -= MOD;
                }
            }
        }
        return f[target];
    }
};
