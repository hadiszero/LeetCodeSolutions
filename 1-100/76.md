# 75. Sort Colors
Difficulty medium

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.


## Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```


## Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]
```


```
Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 300
nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.
```

```
class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size(), l = 0, r = n - 1, idx = 0;
        while (idx <= r) {
            if (nums[idx] == 0) swap(nums[l++], nums[idx++]);
            else if (nums[idx] == 1) ++idx;
            else swap(nums[idx], nums[r--]);
        }
    }
};
