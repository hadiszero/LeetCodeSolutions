# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Difficulty medium

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.


## Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```


## Example 2:
```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```


## Example 3:
```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```


```
Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
```

```
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        bool hash[128] = {};
        int ans = 0, l = 0, r = 0, cnt = 0;
        while (r < s.length()) {
            int c = s[r++];
            while (hash[c]) {hash[s[l++]] = false; --cnt;}
            hash[c] = true;
            ans = max(ans, ++cnt);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
