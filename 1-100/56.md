# 56. Merge Intervals
Difficulty medium

Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.


## Example 1:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].
```


## Example 2:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
```


```
Constraints:

1 <= intervals.length <= 104
intervals[i].length == 2
0 <= starti <= endi <= 104
```

public:
    vector<vector<int>> merge(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end());
        vector<vector<int>> ans;
        int l = 0, r = 0, n = intervals.size();
        while (r < n) {
            int from = intervals[l][0], to = intervals[l][1];
            r = l;
            while (r < n && intervals[r][0] <= to) {
                to = max(to, intervals[r][1]);
                ++r;
            }
            l = r;
            ans.push_back({from, to});
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
