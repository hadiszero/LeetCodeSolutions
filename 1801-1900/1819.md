# 1819. Number of Different Subsequences GCDs
Difficulty hard

You are given an array nums that consists of positive integers.

The GCD of a sequence of numbers is defined as the greatest integer that divides all the numbers in the sequence evenly.

For example, the GCD of the sequence [4,6,16] is 2.
A subsequence of an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing some elements (possibly none) of the array.

For example, [2,5,10] is a subsequence of [1,2,1,2,4,1,5,10].
Return the number of different GCDs among all non-empty subsequences of nums.


## Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [6,10,3]
Output: 5
Explanation: The figure shows all the non-empty subsequences and their GCDs.
The different GCDs are 6, 10, 3, 2, and 1.
```


## Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [5,15,40,5,6]
Output: 7
```


```
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 2 * 105
```

        vector<bool> hash(mx + 1, false);
        for (int num : nums) hash[num] = true;
        for (int i = 1; i <= mx; ++i) {
            int subGcd = 0;
            for (int j = i; j <= mx; j += i) {
                if (!hash[j]) continue;
                if (subGcd == 0) subGcd = j;
                else subGcd = gcd(subGcd, j);
                if (subGcd == i) {
                    ans++;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
