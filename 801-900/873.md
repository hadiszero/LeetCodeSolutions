# 873. Length of Longest Fibonacci Subsequence
Difficulty medium

A sequence x1, x2, ..., xn is Fibonacci-like if:

n >= 3
xi + xi+1 == xi+2 for all i + 2 <= n
Given a strictly increasing array arr of positive integers forming a sequence, return the length of the longest Fibonacci-like subsequence of arr. If one does not exist, return 0.

A subsequence is derived from another sequence arr by deleting any number of elements (including none) from arr, without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, [3, 5, 8] is a subsequence of [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].


## Example 1:
```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest subsequence that is fibonacci-like: [1,2,3,5,8].
```


## Example 2:
```
Input: arr = [1,3,7,11,12,14,18]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest subsequence that is fibonacci-like: [1,11,12], [3,11,14] or [7,11,18].
```


```
Constraints:

3 <= arr.length <= 1000
1 <= arr[i] < arr[i + 1] <= 109
```

        vector<vector<int>> f(n, vector<int>(n));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0 && j + 2 > ans; --j) {
                if (arr[i] - arr[j] >= arr[j]) break;
                auto itr = hash.find(arr[i] - arr[j]);
                if (itr == hash.end()) continue;
                f[i][j] = max(3, f[j][itr->second] + 1);
                ans = max(ans, f[i][j]);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
