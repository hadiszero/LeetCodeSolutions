# 313. Super Ugly Number
Difficulty medium

A super ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are in the array primes.

Given an integer n and an array of integers primes, return the nth super ugly number.

The nth super ugly number is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.


## Example 1:
```
Input: n = 12, primes = [2,7,13,19]
Output: 32
Explanation: [1,2,4,7,8,13,14,16,19,26,28,32] is the sequence of the first 12 super ugly numbers given primes = [2,7,13,19].
```


## Example 2:
```
Input: n = 1, primes = [2,3,5]
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are in the array primes = [2,3,5].
```


```
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 105
1 <= primes.length <= 100
2 <= primes[i] <= 1000
primes[i] is guaranteed to be a prime number.
All the values of primes are unique and sorted in ascending order.
```

    int nthSuperUglyNumber(int n, vector<int>& primes) {

        pq.push(1);
        while (n-- > 0) {
            long x = pq.top(); pq.pop();
            if (n == 0) return x;
            for (int k : primes) {
                if (k <= INT_MAX / x) pq.push(k * x);
                if (x % k == 0) break;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
