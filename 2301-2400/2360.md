# 2360. Longest Cycle in a Graph
Difficulty

You are given a directed graph of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1, where each node has at most one outgoing edge.

The graph is represented with a given 0-indexed array edges of size n, indicating that there is a directed edge from node i to node edges[i]. If there is no outgoing edge from node i, then edges[i] == -1.

Return the length of the longest cycle in the graph. If no cycle exists, return -1.

A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same node.


## Example 1:
```
Input: edges = [3,3,4,2,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest cycle in the graph is the cycle: 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2.
The length of this cycle is 3, so 3 is returned.
```


## Example 2:
```
Input: edges = [2,-1,3,1]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no cycles in this graph.
```


```
Constraints:

n == edges.length
2 <= n <= 105
-1 <= edges[i] < n
edges[i] != i
```

class Solution {
public:
    int longestCycle(vector<int>& edges) {
        int n = edges.size(), ans = -1;
        vector<int> cnt(n);
        for (int i = 0, clock = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            if (cnt[i]) continue;
            for (int x = i, start_time = clock; x >= 0; x = edges[x]) {
                if (cnt[x] > 0) {
                    if (cnt[x] >= start_time) ans = max(ans, clock - cnt[x]);
                    break;
                }
                cnt[x] = clock++;
            }
        }
        return ans;        
    }
};
