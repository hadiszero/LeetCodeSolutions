# 1443. Minimum Time to Collect All Apples in a Tree
Difficulty medium

Given an undirected tree consisting of n vertices numbered from 0 to n-1, which has some apples in their vertices. You spend 1 second to walk over one edge of the tree. Return the minimum time in seconds you have to spend to collect all apples in the tree, starting at vertex 0 and coming back to this vertex.

The edges of the undirected tree are given in the array edges, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] means that exists an edge connecting the vertices ai and bi. Additionally, there is a boolean array hasApple, where hasApple[i] = true means that vertex i has an apple; otherwise, it does not have any apple.


## Example 1:
```
Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple = [false,false,true,false,true,true,false]
Output: 8 
Explanation: The figure above represents the given tree where red vertices have an apple. One optimal path to collect all apples is shown by the green arrows.  
```


## Example 2:
```
Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple = [false,false,true,false,false,true,false]
Output: 6
Explanation: The figure above represents the given tree where red vertices have an apple. One optimal path to collect all apples is shown by the green arrows.  
```


## Example 3:
```
Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple = [false,false,false,false,false,false,false]
Output: 0
```


```
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 105
edges.length == n - 1
edges[i].length == 2
0 <= ai < bi <= n - 1
fromi < toi
hasApple.length == n
```

    int dfs(int cur, int val) {
        if (vis[cur]) return 0;
        vis[cur] = true;

        int child = 0;
        for (int n : g[cur]) child += dfs(n, 2);
        if (child == 0 && !has[cur]) return 0;
        return child + val;
    }

    int minTime(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<bool>& hasApple) {
        has = hasApple;
        g.assign(n, vector<int>());
        vis.assign(n, false);
        for (auto& e : edges) {
            g[e[0]].push_back(e[1]);
            g[e[1]].push_back(e[0]);
        }
        return dfs(0, 0);
    }
};
