# 1437. Check If All 1's Are at Least Length K Places Away
Difficulty easy

Given an binary array nums and an integer k, return true if all 1's are at least k places away from each other, otherwise return false.


## Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1], k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Each of the 1s are at least 2 places away from each other.
```


## Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1], k = 2
Output: false
Explanation: The second 1 and third 1 are only one apart from each other.
```


```
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
0 <= k <= nums.length
nums[i] is 0 or 1
```


#
```
class Solution {
public:
    bool kLengthApart(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size(), prev = -k - 10;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (nums[i] == 0) continue;
            if ((i - prev - 1) < k) return false;
            prev = i;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```
