# 面试题 16.02. Words Frequency LCCI
Difficulty medium

Design a method to find the frequency of occurrences of any given word in a book. What if we were running this algorithm multiple times?

You should implement following methods:

WordsFrequency(book) constructor, parameter is a array of strings, representing the book.
get(word) get the frequency of word in the book. 


## Example:
```
WordsFrequency wordsFrequency = new WordsFrequency({"i", "have", "an", "apple", "he", "have", "a", "pen"});
wordsFrequency.get("you"); //returns 0，"you" is not in the book
wordsFrequency.get("have"); //returns 2，"have" occurs twice in the book
wordsFrequency.get("an"); //returns 1
wordsFrequency.get("apple"); //returns 1
wordsFrequency.get("pen"); //returns 1
Note:

There are only lowercase letters in book[i].
1 <= book.length <= 100000
1 <= book[i].length <= 10
get function will not be called more than 100000 times.
```


#
```
class WordsFrequency {
public:
    WordsFrequency* links[128] = {};
    int cnt = 0;

    WordsFrequency() {}

    WordsFrequency(vector<string>& book) {
        for (auto& b : book) {
            WordsFrequency* cur = this;
            for (char c : b) {
                if (!cur->links[c]) cur->links[c] = new WordsFrequency();
                cur = cur->links[c];
            }
            ++(cur->cnt);
        }
    }
    
    int get(string word) {
        WordsFrequency* cur = this;
        for (char c : word) {
            if (!cur->links[c]) return 0;
            cur = cur->links[c];
        }
        return cur->cnt;
    }
};

/**
 * Your WordsFrequency object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * WordsFrequency* obj = new WordsFrequency(book);
 * int param_1 = obj->get(word);
 */
