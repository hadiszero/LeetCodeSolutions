# 264. Ugly Number II
Difficulty medium

An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer n, return the nth ugly number.


## Example 1:
```
Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12] is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
```


## Example 2:
```
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
```


```
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1690
```

            f[i] = min(f[p2] * 2, min(f[p3] * 3, f[p5] * 5));
            if (f[i] == f[p2] * 2) ++p2;
            if (f[i] == f[p3] * 3) ++p3;
            if (f[i] == f[p5] * 5) ++p5;
        }
        return f[n];
    }
};
