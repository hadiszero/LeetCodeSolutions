# 1335. Minimum Difficulty of a Job Schedule
Difficulty hard

You want to schedule a list of jobs in d days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the ith job, you have to finish all the jobs j where 0 <= j < i).

You have to finish at least one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the d days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done on that day.

You are given an integer array jobDifficulty and an integer d. The difficulty of the ith job is jobDifficulty[i].

Return the minimum difficulty of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return -1.


## Example 1:
```
Input: jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: First day you can finish the first 5 jobs, total difficulty = 6.
Second day you can finish the last job, total difficulty = 1.
The difficulty of the schedule = 6 + 1 = 7 
```


## Example 2:
```
Input: jobDifficulty = [9,9,9], d = 4
Output: -1
Explanation: If you finish a job per day you will still have a free day. you cannot find a schedule for the given jobs.
```


## Example 3:
```
Input: jobDifficulty = [1,1,1], d = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The schedule is one job per day. total difficulty will be 3.
```


```
Constraints:

1 <= jobDifficulty.length <= 300
0 <= jobDifficulty[i] <= 1000
1 <= d <= 10
```

class Solution {
public:
    int minDifficulty(vector<int>& jobDifficulty, int d) {
        int n = jobDifficulty.size();
        if (n < d) return -1;

        vector<vector<int>> f(d, vector<int>(n, 0x3f3f3f3f));
        int mx = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            mx = max(mx, jobDifficulty[i]);
            f[0][i] = mx;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < d; ++i) {
            for (int j = i; j < n; ++j) {
                int mx = 0;
                for (int k = j; k >= i; --k) {
                    mx = max(mx, jobDifficulty[k]);
                    f[i][j] = min(f[i][j], f[i - 1][k - 1] + mx);
                }
            }
        }
        return f[d - 1][n - 1];
    }
};
