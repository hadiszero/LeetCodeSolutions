# 187. Repeated DNA Sequences
Difficulty medium

The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

For example, "ACGAATTCCG" is a DNA sequence.
When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Given a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in any order.


## Example 1:
```
Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
Output: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]
```


## Example 2:
```
Input: s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"
Output: ["AAAAAAAAAA"]
```


```
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is either 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'.
```

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findRepeatedDnaSequences(string s) {
        if (s.length() < 10) return {};
        unordered_map<string, int> hash;
        vector<string> ans;
        for (int i = 0; i <= s.length() - 10; ++i) {
            string&& tmp = s.substr(i, 10);
            if (++hash[tmp] == 2) ans.push_back(tmp);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
