# 151. Reverse Words in a String
Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.


## Example 1:
```
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
```


## Example 2:
```
Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
```


## Example 3:
```
Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
```


```
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.
There is at least one word in s.
```


```
Follow-up: If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it in-place with O(1) extra space?
```

        string tmp;
        while (cur < s.length()) {
            if (s[cur] == ' ') {
                if (tmp.length() > 0) {
                    dq.push_front(tmp);
                    tmp = "";
                }
            } else {
                tmp.push_back(s[cur]);
            }
            ++cur;
        }
        if (tmp.length() > 0) dq.push_front(tmp);

        string ans;
        while (!dq.empty()) {
            ans.append(dq.front());
            dq.pop_front();
            ans.push_back(' ');
        }
        ans.pop_back();
        return ans;
    }
