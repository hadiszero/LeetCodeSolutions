# 2507. Smallest Value After Replacing With Sum of Prime Factors
Difficulty medium

You are given a positive integer n.

Continuously replace n with the sum of its prime factors.

Note that if a prime factor divides n multiple times, it should be included in the sum as many times as it divides n.
Return the smallest value n will take on.


## Example 1:
```
Input: n = 15
Output: 5
Explanation: Initially, n = 15.
15 = 3 * 5, so replace n with 3 + 5 = 8.
8 = 2 * 2 * 2, so replace n with 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.
6 = 2 * 3, so replace n with 2 + 3 = 5.
5 is the smallest value n will take on.
```


## Example 2:
```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Initially, n = 3.
3 is the smallest value n will take on.
```


```
Constraints:

2 <= n <= 105
```

class Solution {
public:
    int smallestValue(int n) {
        int ans = n;
        while (true) {
            int cur = ans, sum = 0, div = 2;
            while (div * div <= cur) {
                while (cur % div == 0) {
                    sum += div;
                    cur /= div;
                }
                ++div;
            }
            if (cur > 1) sum += cur;
            if (sum == ans) break;
            ans = sum;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
