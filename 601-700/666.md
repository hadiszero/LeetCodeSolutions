# 666. Path Sum IV
Difficulty medium

If the depth of a tree is smaller than 5, then this tree can be represented by an array of three-digit integers. For each integer in this array:

The hundreds digit represents the depth d of this node where 1 <= d <= 4.
The tens digit represents the position p of this node in the level it belongs to where 1 <= p <= 8. The position is the same as that in a full binary tree.
The units digit represents the value v of this node where 0 <= v <= 9.
Given an array of ascending three-digit integers nums representing a binary tree with a depth smaller than 5, return the sum of all paths from the root towards the leaves.

It is guaranteed that the given array represents a valid connected binary tree.

 
## Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [113,215,221]
Output: 12
Explanation: The tree that the list represents is shown.
The path sum is (3 + 5) + (3 + 1) = 12.
```


## Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [113,221]
Output: 4
Explanation: The tree that the list represents is shown. 
The path sum is (3 + 1) = 4.
```


```
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 15
110 <= nums[i] <= 489
nums represents a valid binary tree with depth less than 5.
```
