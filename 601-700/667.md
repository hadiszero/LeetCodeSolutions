# 667. Beautiful Arrangement II
Difficulty medium

Given two integers n and k, construct a list answer that contains n different positive integers ranging from 1 to n and obeys the following requirement:

Suppose this list is answer = [a1, a2, a3, ... , an], then the list [|a1 - a2|, |a2 - a3|, |a3 - a4|, ... , |an-1 - an|] has exactly k distinct integers.
Return the list answer. If there multiple valid answers, return any of them.


## Example 1:
```
Input: n = 3, k = 1
Output: [1,2,3]
Explanation: The [1,2,3] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [1,1] has exactly 1 distinct integer: 1
```


## Example 2:
```
Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: [1,3,2]
Explanation: The [1,3,2] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [2,1] has exactly 2 distinct integers: 1 and 2.
```


```
Constraints:

1 <= k < n <= 104
```

    vector<int> constructArray(int n, int k) {
        vector<int> ans(n);
        int t = n - (k + 1);
        for (int i = 0; i < t; ++i) ans[i] = i + 1;
        for (int i = t, l = t + 1, r = n; i < n;) {
            ans[i++] = l++;
            if (i < n) ans[i++] = r--;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
