# 438. Find All Anagrams in a String
Difficulty medium

Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's anagrams in s. You may return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.


## Example 1:
```
Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
Output: [0,6]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
```


## Example 2:
```
Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
Output: [0,1,2]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
```


```
Constraints:

1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 104
s and p consist of lowercase English letters.
```

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findAnagrams(string s, string p) {
        constexpr int LEN = 128;
        int n = s.length(), m = p.length();
        int hash[LEN] = {}, cnt = 0;
        for (char c : p) {
            if (++hash[c] == 1) ++cnt;
        }

        vector<int> ans;
        for (int l = 0, r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
            if (--hash[s[r]] == 0) --cnt;
            if (r - l + 1 > m && ++hash[s[l++]] == 1) ++cnt;
            if (cnt == 0) ans.push_back(l);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
